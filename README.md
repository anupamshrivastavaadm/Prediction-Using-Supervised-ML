# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML

Here's Python code that predicts the percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied using linear regression:

In this Machine Learning model, the dataset student_scores.csv contains two columns: the number of hours studied and the percentage score obtained. After loading the dataset using pandas and split it into features (hours) and target (scores) arrays. After training a linear regression model on the data and use it to predict the percentage score for 9.25 hours of study per day. After plotting the data and the regression line using matplotlib to visualize the relationship between hours studied and percentage score. Finally, evaluating the model's performance using mean squared error and print the predicted score for 9.25 hours of study per day.
